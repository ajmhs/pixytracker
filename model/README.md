The Model is now created via System Designer vs. RtiDDSgen tool

As such we've left behind the system designer project directory (in case a model modification is ever required) and the xml file. 
This file will now replace the USER_QOS_PROFILES dir in the top level run directory

TODO: put in a URL in the code to select the XML file
